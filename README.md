## Getting Started

1. Clone this Repository

```
git clone https://github.com/underoot/underoot.github.io
```

2. Navigate to the directory

```
cd underoot.github.io
```

3. Have a look at `eleventy.config.js` to see if you want to configure any Eleventy options differently.
4. Install dependencies

```
yarn
```

5. Run Eleventy

Generate a production-ready build:

```
npx @11ty/eleventy
```

Or build and host locally on a local development server:

```
npx @11ty/eleventy --serve
```

Or you can run [debug mode](https://www.11ty.dev/docs/debugging/) to see all the internals.
