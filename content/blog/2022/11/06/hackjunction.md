On 4-6 November, I took part in the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20221103155752/https://www.junction2022.com/" target="_blank">Junction 2022</a> hackathon. It was amazing. I worked in a team together with my ex-colleague Aleksey Khlebaev. We have developed an application that measures the pulse when browsing websites.

Two days of non-stop coding and devops-ing with a lot of fast learning of D3, Next.js, WatchKit, and the GCP infrastructure.

So nice to see a lot of bright minds around with crazy ideas about the sustainable, hopeful, adventurous feature.

A couple of important takeaways:
- Realization is okay, but pitching an idea is better. Presentation, a wow-effect demo will help you to catch someone's attention. By the way, Junction had useful workshops about pitching with many insights.

- Think twice about a problem before starting. But don't give up even if you think that you a stuck in your problem. It's very easy to find someone who will find your idea interesting.

- Hackathons it's a fantastic opportunity not only to try your luck and professional skills but grow up your network üëç
