Was traveling today with my family near <a href="https://osm.org/go/0xgBViQcX--?node=1973429338" target="_blank">Paunküla</a> on <a href="https://osm.org/go/0xKr2YL?relation=5424653" target="_blank">the hiking trail</a> and enjoyed meditative sceneries in spring winter with shiny snow under the Sun, lakes, covered by ice, evergreen pines, and snowy slopes.

A full switch of environment helps to reboot before the next workweek!
