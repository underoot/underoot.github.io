Last week we rented bicycles and even accidentally met during one ride the large bike parade. We enjoyed the time with bicycles and perhaps will plan to buy our own later.

Also last weekend I reproduced an interesting optics physical experiment called <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camera_obscura" target="_blank">camera obscura</a>: in the dark completely isolated from the light room you cut a small hole in the wall (or, i.e., in a cardboard box which covers windows like in my case). Through this small hole image of everything that is happening outside will be displayed on the opposite wall with a small nuance: it will be reflected vertically. The last time I saw this phenomenon in childhood. It was so exciting to see it after many years
