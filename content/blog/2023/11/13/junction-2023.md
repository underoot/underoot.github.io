So, last weekend was an incredible time to work with our fantastic team of engineers and, more important, the product who helped us balance our vision.

Finally, we haven't won anything, but we saw that our idea was correct and we were witnesses when our idea were better implemented as a concept by another team, but without proper realization.

The idea is quite simple: it's an application, which motivates children to repeat dance movements after their favourite YouTube or TikTok creator.  Well, our competitors on track made a little bit more solid concept, but, we anyway spend our time by hacking, a little bit of networking.

I saw a lot of hate speech (which is bad meanwhile) that hackaton becomes more focused on concepts rather than prototypes (see the latest attached screenshot). Well, I cannot totally agree with that, and I think that concept and clear message by product/idea/whatever is more important
