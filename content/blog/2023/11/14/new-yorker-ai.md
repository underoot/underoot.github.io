AI was chosen even as a word of year <a href="https://blog.collinsdictionary.com/language-lovers/the-acceleration-of-ai-and-other-2023-trends/" target="_blank">according to Collins dictionary</a>.

One of the features of the New Yorker is a cover, which is designed by artists. In this issue they created <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/culture/cover-story/cover-story-2023-11-20">a special application</a> for generating your own cover.
