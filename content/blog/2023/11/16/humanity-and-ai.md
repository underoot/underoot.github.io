As it's the second post about New Yorker you might guess that I'm a big fan of their works.

So, a lot of essays, illustrations and discussions come from their recent issues and one of them is dedicated to similarities and differences between A.I. and human beings.

Well, roughly speaking in the basement of both of us are the same mechanisms the thinking process looks like. And the same question and thoughts come to mind of cartoonist and editor illustrator Angie Wang. She raises her toddler and has started to compare A.I. and her son in terms of thoughts, how they study, and generate words. She <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/humor/sketchbook/is-my-toddler-a-stochastic-parrot" target="_blank">drew heart touching cartoons</a> about A.I. about humans and our future.
