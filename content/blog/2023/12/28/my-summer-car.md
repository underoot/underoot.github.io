I moved to Helsinki this year and I've started this long process of adaptation and learning.

Found accidentally in the Internet <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/516750/My_Summer_Car/" target="_blank">funny game</a> about 18/19 years old boy who stayed in fictional area of Peräjärvi in Finland for summer while his parents flew for vacation to Tenerife. The gameplay is to built and repair in garage with hundreds of spare parts a car, drive on it to surrounding nowhere, drink beer, take a sauna.

Well... Definitely the best game for my immigration learning
