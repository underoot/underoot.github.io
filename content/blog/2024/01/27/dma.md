A recent <a href="https://digital-markets-act.ec.europa.eu/" target="_blank">European Digital Markets Act</a> (DMA) made Apple to act

From iOS 17.4 it will be possible <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/1/25/24050200/apple-third-party-app-stores-allowed-iphone-ios-europe-digital-markets-act" target="_blank">to install applications from third-party stores</a>, which will be approved by Apple and applications will be checked separately for possible malware. Apple is doing a couple of tricks, as it usually happens when you face your business with some legal restrictions: first of all when developer's app crossed the threshold of millions of installations in an EU developer will pay 0.5€ per annual install. If developers want to receive payments through Apple they must pay a 3% fee for that.

**UPD** Also Apple said, <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2024/01/25/apple-says-third-party-app-marketplace-creators-must-have-e1000000-letter-of-credit/" target="_blank">alternative store developers must have 1e6€ letter of credit</a>. Well, another trick

But a more important part, I would say a million times more important thing that Apple finally allowed <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/1/25/24050478/apple-ios-17-4-browser-engines-eu" target="_blank">alternative browser engines inside iOS</a>. It's good news in my opinion. WebKit has monopolized iOS all that time. Some things stay the same for a long time like old bugs and strange technical limitations. But it's too early to be happy with these changes. First of all it's only related to the EU. Another interesting fact is that Apple in all official press releases only mentioned iOS and kept silent about iPadOS I hope that iOS means both platforms. And the last, but not the least: I'm pretty sure that browsers, which will stay in the App Store will face strict regulations and restrictions from the Apple side. Even <a href="https://developer.apple.com/support/alternative-browser-engines/">in the official support post</a> Apple remarked "Apple will only authorize developers to implement alternative browser engines after meeting specific criteria  <...>", because of potential security threats.

So, let's see how it goes. Alternatives are always good I suppose. I hope that Apple's reflected decision will help to improve and evolve its platforms under pressure of some level of competition.
