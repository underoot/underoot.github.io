Once upon a time, during one long winter evening between my test assignment for new job and falling asleep exhausted I've decided to build one simple art object, which I wanted to build long time ago. It's visualization of ruble exchange rate dynamics to USA dollar in form of a roller coaster in 3D from first point of view. Exchange rate fluctuates a lot, so it's a good metaphor for roller coaster, isn't it?

I gathered data from <a href="http://www.cbr.ru/currency_base/dynamics/?UniDbQuery.Posted=True&UniDbQuery.VAL_NM_RQ=r01235" target="_blank">Central Bank of Russia</a> and made my hands dirty with scripts to prepare data, Blender to create simple crossbars, which will build chart^W railroad track and Three.JS to make it happened â€” _VoilÃ !_.

Recently I decided that I'm too lazy to finalize it to perfect state, so I'm publishing it as is.
