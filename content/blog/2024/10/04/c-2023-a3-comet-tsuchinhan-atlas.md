Hey everyone! As you know, I’m a bit of a space enthusiast and even have a telescope. But after moving to Europe, I didn’t get to use it much. But guess what? I’ve got some exciting news to share with you! 

Get ready to witness the comet [C/2023 A3 (Tsuchinshan-ATLAS)](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/C/2023_A3_(Tsuchinshan%E2%80%93ATLAS) in the northern latitudes! It’ll be visible closer to sunset as a quiet, bright object with a tail. Mark your calendars for October, because this comet is going to be a sight to behold! 

I’ve attached some screenshots showing an emulated view of the comet in the sky for October 15th from Stellarium software. You can also see the anticipated path of the comet for October. Don’t miss out on this celestial spectacle!
