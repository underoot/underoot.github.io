summary: Firefox Nightly is being tested in the wild, and I didn't even notice it.

  For a long time, I was using Firefox Nightly on the desktop and on my mobile phone. Recently, I realized that I was using a nightly build when I saw the testing label "I'm a temporary text to indicate you're on the new Tab Fragment" on the new tab interface.

For a long time I've been using Firefox Nightly on the desktop and on my mobile phone. Some time ago I even built it locally when I did browser architecture research, and I almost never saw anything strange except for a couple of crashes. I even forgot that I'm using nightly builds; one benefit instead is that you receive early hands-on experience with new features, or you can complain about poorly developed ones (like [WebGPU](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1911493), for example).

But recently, I realized that I was using a nightly build when I saw the testing label "I'm a temporary text to indicate you're on the new Tab Fragment" on the new tab interface.
